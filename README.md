> **abstract:** Face swapping has attracted great attention for its wide range of applications. Although recent works have made gratifying progress, their swapping results tend to be inconsistent with large appearance gaps between the source and the target images. Such appearance gaps mainly come from the large discrepancies in illuminations and skin colors, widely exist in real-world scenarios. However, due to the difficulties of modeling the complex appearance mapping, it is challenging to transfer fine-grained appearances adaptively with identical traits preservation. This paper formulates appearance mapping as an optimal transport problem and proposes an Appearance Optimal Transport model (AOT) to settle it in both latent and pixel space. Specifically, on the one hand, a relighting generator is designed to simulate the optimal transport plan. It is solved via minimizing Wasserstein distance of the learned features in the latent space, bringing better performance and less computation than the conventional optimization manner. On the other hand, in order to further refine the solution of the optimal transport plan, we develop a segmentation game to minimize the Wasserstein distance in the pixel space. A discriminator is introduced to distinguish the fake parts from a mix of real and fake image patches. Extensive experiments reveal the superiority of our method in the large appearance gaps situation, when compared with state-of-the-art methods.
